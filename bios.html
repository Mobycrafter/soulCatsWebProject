                Born in Kansas to his  father, Dave Peck, who was a professional musician band leader, and music teacher, Bob got his start pulling the bass drum cart for his father's high school marching band at the age of six. By the time he was eight years old he had graduated to marching  snare playing in Central Coast parades and band camps.
                As a teen, Bob started several of his own bands, such as Four Play, Frog, Forest, and Motor Head, covering 70's rock. 
                In the '90's Bob and his family relocated to Casper, Wyoming where he put together heavy metal bands, Strych IX and Graven Image, and a power trio named Trilogy playing all original music in local venues and  state competitions. 
                Returning to the Central Coast in the early 2000's, Bob and his wife, Vicky, formed an acoustic band called The Believers with Bob on the jembe and Vicky on percussion and back up vocals. Covering old school country music, blues, and rock and roll, The Believers played local venues such as Solvang's Royal Copenhagen Hotel and The Touch and Los Alamos' Ghostriders and Steel Horse saloons.
                In 2014 Bob was introduced to Michael Roberts and invited to play drums for The Soulcats.

                Being the Son of the our church organist and choir director, I was introduced to music at a very young age. I started playing sax in 1973 because I was a really bad flute player! Most of my experience has been in Big Band Jazz (Richard Clark Big Band 14 years, Riptide Big Band 10 years, along with several large church orchestras, collage and community bands.)

                I've always had a passion for Blues and Soul music! Joining Soul Cats has allowed me to explore my Soul Side! But playing Cow Bell has been the ultimate musical experience!
